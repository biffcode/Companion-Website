1. Acknowledge her focus and the club’s priorities
• Ingrid Ehrenberg is deeply involved in the Education Committee of the HBS Club of New York’s Community Partners program ￼. That means she cares about educational impact.
• The HBS Alumni Angels of Greater New York is the largest Harvard‑affiliated angel group in the area (350+ members, ~$31 M invested, ~1–2 deals/month) ￼.

In your opener, reference both:

“Ingrid, I know you lead the Education efforts within the HBS NY club—and that the Alumni Angels are actively seeking high-growth, impact-driven startups. That’s why I’m excited to share why GetAIOS aligns on both fronts…”

2. Front-load educational or productivity impact

Since Ingrid champions education, position GetAIOS as a powerful learning and productivity tool for individuals and teams:
• Optimize learning workflows: emphasize how educators, students, and trainers can use AIOS to access diverse AI models, automate note-taking, generate quizzes—all without technical setup.
• Demonstrate immediate outcomes: show a short demo scenario (e.g., a student querying their filesystem or having AI generate summaries from lecture materials).

3. Tie into angel-group criteria

HBS Angels look for: early-stage startups with high growth potential, scalable business models, and strong founders ￼.

Craft your pitch around:
• Scalability: “With our Model Context Protocol (MCP), AIOS can integrate into any existing workflow—no need for custom API work.”
• Market potential: highlight use cases across education technology plus other verticals (enterprise, SMB), with a growing base in multiple AI providers.
• Founding team & traction: briefly outline founder experience, beta users, usage metrics (e.g. weekly active users, pilot feedback).

4. A suggested message structure

Email/intro message to Ingrid:

⸻

Subject: AIOS: Hands-on AI for education — scalable, ready for pilots

Body:
“Hi Ingrid — great to meet you tomorrow. I’m thrilled to share GetAIOS, a desktop AI operating system built to empower educators, students, and professionals by letting them directly orchestrate multiple AI models—no coding required.

Given your leadership on HBS NY’s Education Committee and the Angels’ focus on high-growth, impact-driven startups, I’d love your feedback on our pilot with 20 university schools. It’s already saving instructors 4–6 hours/week on grading and content prep, and rolling out for broader deployment.

Could you imagine recommending AIOS to your fellow angels as a next-gen EdTech investment—or even better, introducing us to a relevant pilot partner? Would love to explore next steps.”

⸻

5. Key persuaders to highlight
• Social proof: “Trusted by university instructors”—if you have testimonials or time-savings metrics.
• Market traction: early sign‑ups, commitment letters, pilot interest.
• Competitive edge: emphasize multi‑provider support and voice integration as unique differentiators.

⸻

6. Ask clearly

End your message with a concrete ask:
• “Would you be open to introducing us to one angel who leads EdTech investments?”
• Or: “Could I pitch at the next HBS Alumni Angels round?”

That gives Ingrid a clear and easy way to help you — she’s more likely to act.
